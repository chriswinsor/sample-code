# sample-code
This repository holds some examples of code that I have written for various assignments over the years.

In csc226/4 is NetworkFlow.java which the code for an assignment where we had to find the max flow for a directed graph that is provided by the user or from a file.

In csc226 is HeapTester.java which I wrote because I needed a good flexible heap for a few assignments. It contains the class HeapElement which you can change when implementing in other programs. The heap will still work after changing HeapElement as long as you call the variable that the heap uses to compare two elements weight.

seng265/python/assign3 contains formatter.py and sengfmt2.py written in python 3. sengfmt2.py takes in a text file with formatting instructions from stdin and outputs the formatted text file into stdout. formatter.py is what sengfmt2.py uses to format the file.

seng265/C/assign4 contains the files used to do the same thing as seng265/python/assign3 but using C insted of python.
